                        <h3>For kids</h3>
                        <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum,
                            there’s plenty to see and do.
                            You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time
                            and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for
                            interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
                            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and
                            13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
                            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children
                            your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To
                            find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

                        <h3>For Teachers</h3>
                        <p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and
                            exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them
                            in our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
                            inspire them.
                            Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time
                            to bring your students through for a visit.

                        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
                        <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and
                            ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see
                            behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch
                            where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and
                            strategies for the museum.
                            Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
